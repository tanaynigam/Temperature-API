## Temperature-API

Write an API application that allows users to check the current temperature.

The API application should provide one route:

GET /locations/{zip-code}

The response should be returned with 200 status code with a payload in JSON format 
as follows:

{
    "temperature": number
    "scale": "string"
}

where "temperature" is a number representing the current temperature of the specified 
zip code and "scale" is either "Fahrenheit" and "Celsius".

By default, Fahrenheit will be returned.  However, users can optionally specify 
"scale" as a query string when making a call.

Example:

To get Blacksburg's current temperature:

Request:

GET /locations/24060

Response:

200

{
    "temperature": 43
    "scale": "Fahrenheit"
}


To get Beverly Hills, California's current temperature in Celsius:

Request:

GET /locations/90210?scale=Celsius

Response:

200

{
    "temperature": 25
    "scale": "Celsius"
}


To get Chicago's current temperature in Fahrenheit:

Request:

GET /locations/60606?scale=Fahrenheit

Response:

200

{
    "temperature": 63
    "scale": "Fahrenheit"
}

## Requirements

### Must Haves
These are the requirements your submission must fulfill to be considered 
correct.

* The application is developed using either JavaScript or TypeScript.
* The application is available at `http://localhost:8080` after invoking 
  `npm install` followed by `npm start`
* Your code is something you'd be comfortable putting in production and 
  having your team maintaining
* Send us a URL to a public git repo or a zip file containing all source code 
  and any artifacts for the solution.  Please do not include any binary files.

### Should Have
These should be fulfilled, but if they aren't please let us know why.

* Your code is tested in some automated fashion when invoking `npm test`
* Source control history (e.g. the `.git` directory or a link to Github)

### Nice to Have
Stretch goals. If you fulfill these requirements, you get bonus points, but 
they aren't required.

* Design rationale

### Time constraint
We look forward to reviewing your solution within a few day from the time we 
sent this assignment to you.
